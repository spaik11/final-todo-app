# Final-Todo-App
This is my version of the todo app. 
* You will be able to see each task you add with an indicator to see if you completed the item or not. 
* There is a change todo feature that lets you select a todo item and change the todo.
* You can select the items that are completed, along with a toggle all feature.
* The last feature is that the add todo button will include a delete button for each task.

### Tools and Challenges
I implemented jQuery to the todo app. I used it to change the font color and add a hover effect on the buttons. jQuery makes it very easy to manipulate the DOM.

I faced the following challenges:
* I can click anywhere on the todo line and the todo deletes.
